AI 
- ai in groups

    - playing animations and audio
    - agro on targets
- agro'd
    - attack towards player
    - take cover
    - retreat
    - emit audio / play animation (taunt)

TRAPS
bear traps -> hit trigger -> stuck in trapped -> play anim
    design:
        - integrated into environment hidden
lance -> hit trigger -> warning queue -> projectile fires at you -> if hit restricts movement
laser -> agros AI
    -> enemies can also agro eachother

environment triggers


IMPROVEMENTS:
* weaponed blocked arms state
* crouched state -> shorter and thinner collider (crouch behind 2 crates without getting hit)
* sliding
* crossbow doesn't agro when you kill and enemy but a loud gun does

REFACTOR:
