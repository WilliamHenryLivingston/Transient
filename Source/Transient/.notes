TODO refactor:
Look vectoring all in unitpawn (incl TorsoPitch)
weapon holster slots
"play animation" system in unitpawn
procedual camera push

AI 
- ai in groups
- un-agro'd
    - moveing between points
    - playing animations and audio
    - agro on targets
- agro'd
    - attack towards player
    - take cover
    - retreat
    - emit audio / play animation (taunt)

TRAPS
bear traps -> hit trigger -> stuck in trapped -> play anim
    design:
        - integrated into environment hidden
lance -> hit trigger -> warning queue -> projectile fires at you -> if hit restricts movement
laser -> agros AI
    -> enemies can also agro eachother

environment triggers


IMPROVEMENTS:
* weaponed blocked arms state
* crouched state -> shorter and thinner collider (crouch behind 2 crates without getting hit)
* sliding
* crossbow doesn't agro when you kill and enemy but a loud gun does

REFACTOR:
3x boolean var anim instances lol
packaging
better trigger system

IK
alternate group steps
if group stepping:
    target step position behind
else
    target step position ahead

MORE STUFF:
* grass LOS enemies, push taller grass less
  * grass circle
  * different types of grass
* disguise items
    * resticted areas
* lootable shouln't reopen
* conf stamina burn rate (and for devices + time dilation factor)
  * sprint speed upgradable

// ----
* alert tower
* group agro config
  * conf go to cover to assault
  * conf cover position distance max
  * conf remaining group size before assault

* loot pool (ie chance to spawn with certain item) for enemies and crates

* new backpack
* another leg slot





* SWEEPING
* TRIMMING
* ARMOR INSIGNIA
* Loot pool for boxes








map testing:
* can get hard-locked by running out of bolts early
    - crates with lots of bolts at spawn
      - not op because player can't carry
* church nav bounds broken
* slightly less chokepoints / crates -> more player freedom
  * replace some solid crates with breakable crates?
* mines in more dangerous spots
* high loot enemies could be tougher (new armor and stuff)
* more workers throughout map doing stuff -> more immersive



REMOVING INVENTORY SLOT COLLIDERS; items have their own look collider.
